 * LVGL's timers are paused along with the display (see idle_timers in
 * launcher.c). That is right for anything that exists to draw something, and
 * wrong for anything that has to happen anyway: an alarm has to ring in a
 * pocket, the battery journal has to cover a night with the screen off, and a
 * badge with no RTC has to resync after a day away from its WiFi.
 *
 * 🚨 Why this lives here and not as an esp_timer inside launcher.c. launcher.c
 *    is shared with the simulator, and the simulator has no esp_timer — port.h
 *    is the only thing both sides have. So the capability belongs behind the
 *    seam like every other difference between the board and the PC.
 *
 * On the board this is esp_timer: backed by the hardware timer, and its
 * schedule survives light sleep, which is what makes a one-second alarm tick
 * viable at all. The simulator has neither light sleep nor esp_timer, so it
 * walks the same list whenever its virtual clock moves. That reproduces the one
 * property the interface relies on — these do not stop when the display does.
 *
 * 🚨 Keep this list short. Every entry is a reason for the CPU to wake up, and
