/* The display is brought up here rather than by the BSP.
 *
 * Why not bsp_display_start_with_config(): it keeps the panel handle in its
 * own static and never hands it out. Without the handle there is no way to
 * call esp_lcd_panel_disp_on_off(), and therefore no way to turn the display
 * *actually* off. The BSP's backlight_off only drops the brightness to zero
 * and the panel keeps scanning — measured, "关" still drew 76 mV/h against
 * 171 on, or 44% of being on.
 *
 * Vendoring the whole BSP is not necessary. bsp_display_new() is public and
 * returns the handle. All the BSP's internal bsp_display_lcd_init() did was
 * that plus registering the adapter, so those sixty lines moved here.
 *
 * What that leaves missing are the things that relied on the BSP's statics —
 * brightness, rotation and get_input_dev. All three are rebuilt here against
 * our own handle (0x51, 0x36). The command encoding follows the BSP's, and
 * the MADCTL value was already confirmed on the board.
 *
 * bsp_display_lock/unlock are only wrappers around esp_lv_adapter_lock and
 * are used as they are. */
