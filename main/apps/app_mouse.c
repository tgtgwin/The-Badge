 *
 * Two zones on the trackpad screen:
 *   the inner disc  — drag it, the cursor moves (relative)
 *   the outer ring  — turn it, the page scrolls
 * Clicks come from touch. The only physical button is PWR, which goes through

 * across 1.75 inches is about 266 DPI — a quarter to a sixth of a laptop
 * trackpad (1000-1600). The pad is also only 44 mm across, so crossing a
 * screen needs a large gain, and gain multiplies that coarse grid along with
 * everything else. That is what the steppiness was.
 *
 * But there was a bigger culprit. It used to send one report per touch event.
 * Touch runs at 83 Hz (12 ms); the BLE connection interval is whatever the
 * phone grants, usually 66 Hz (15 ms). They do not divide, so some reports
 * carried one touch step and some carried two. That beat is what you felt.
 *
 * So "send on every event" is gone and speed is the thing passed around:
 *   a touch arrives  -> update the instantaneous speed (counts per second)
 *   the timer fires  -> emit an amount proportional to elapsed time
 * That makes it independent of how many events arrived, and the beat goes
 * away. Fractions are carried, so no distance is lost either.
