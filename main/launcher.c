/* 🚨 Both of these are now constants, and that is the point rather than a
 * tidy-up.
 *
 * They used to be functions of how many apps the page held, because the ring
 * has to shrink as it fills: six icons on one page came out at 92 px. The old
 * author kept them at 120 by splitting the apps over two pages — the comment
 * where the pages used to be said 92 px was hard to hit, and it was right.
 *
 * A constant size is what makes baking the icons possible. tools/mkassets.py
 * bakes each icon at exactly ICON_D and the launcher draws it 1:1; anything
 * else and LVGL resamples it through its transform path, which is a 2x2
 * bilinear with no area averaging and shows up as a rough, grainy edge.
 * 🚨 Change ICON_D here and mkassets.py has to be run again, or every icon is
 * drawn at the wrong size. tools/regress.sh checks that the two agree.
 *
 * 🔢 These are the original sizes — 90 px icons on a 150 px ring with 18 px
 *    names — and they are here on purpose rather than by not having got round to
 *    changing them.
 *
 *    The larger pair that fits was worked out and tried: label 26 px, icon 104,
 *    ring 138. It is measurably more readable — a Chinese glyph is 1.07 mm tall
 *    at 18 px on a panel that is 376 to the inch, and 1.55 mm at 26 — but it is
 *    also denser on a round screen, and on this badge the lighter ring reads
 *    better than the legible one. So the artwork is small and the edges are
 *    clean, which is where the sharpness was always going to come from.
 *    If the names ever need to be read from across a table, the numbers above
 *    are the ones to go back to.
 *
 *    🚨 Whatever they are set to, all four have to be solved together — icons
 *    inside the circle, names inside the circle, names clear of the
 *    *neighbouring* icons, and neighbours not touching. The third is the one
 *    that is easy to miss: a name sits radially outside its own icon, so it
 *    reaches sideways into the sector of the icons either side of it.
 *    tools/regress.sh re-solves all four after every change, because the way
 *    this fails is a name sliding off the edge of a round screen. */

 * The CPU keeps waking even with the display off, and the most frequent
 * reason is reading touch: every 12 ms, or 83 I2C transactions a second. But
 * this device **does not wake on touch** whether it slept by itself or you
 * turned it off (pocket protection — see idle_cb). So there is no reason at
 * all to read touch while it is off. Stop.
 * This is nothing like as dangerous as light sleep. It only pauses timers and
 * starts them again, so the worst case is "touch is a beat late on wake".
 *
 * 🚨 Going dark pauses **every** LVGL timer, not the five the launcher happens
 *    to know about. The old version paused its own and left every app's
 *    running — and since almost every app is keep_awake = false, meaning "happy
 *    to go dark", the timers that survived the dark were exactly the ones with
 *    no reason to. The worst of them was a game's step timer: it wakes fifty
 *    times a second with the panel off and nothing to draw onto.
 *
 * 🚨 Two kinds stay outside this, and both name themselves rather than being
 *    listed here — which is what keeps the list from going stale:
 *      · the port timers (see port.h) — the alarm, the battery journal, the
 *        clock sync. They are not LVGL timers, so this walk cannot even see
 *        them.
 *      · an app whose badge_app_t sets timers_dark. That is the clock, and only
 *        the clock: a countdown has to keep counting in a pocket.
 *
 * 🚨 Nothing may be left paused by accident. Only this file calls
 *    lv_timer_pause / lv_timer_resume anywhere in the firmware, so "was already
 *    paused before this ran" is exactly the launcher's own set. That is what
 *    makes resuming everything and then re-pausing the one timer that wants it
 *    enough, instead of keeping a snapshot of what was paused. It stops being
